My Topic
My topic is a mini project about an online grocery store. Any client can go to the site, sign up and choose the right product and add it to the basket. As soon as the client has finished choosing products, he goes into the basket and pays for the products, and select the delivery methods for this product.

Microservices

user-service
product-service
